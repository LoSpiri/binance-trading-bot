# Binance Trading Bot
 
This is my first personal project and it's intended as a tool for me and my friends to automatically analize and subsequently buy and sell cryptos using the indicators and strategies we are already using to manage our Binance wallets.


REQUIREMENTS:
* Binance API
* Flask (future refactoring with Django)
* Numpy
* TA-Lib
* Backtrader (future addition)

NEXT OBJECTIVE:
* Experiment with TA-Lib indicators
* Implement a backtracking algorithm to test the app on last week data 
* Improve the documentation and comments

TO-DO LIST:
* Add and experiment with Backtrader
* Implement an optional grid trading strategy

If you would like to test it just replace API_KEY and API_SECRET in "config.py" with your private Binance keys.
Any PR is welcomed.
