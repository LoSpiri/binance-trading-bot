# binance-trading-bot
 
This is my first personal project and it's intended to be a tool for me and my friends to automatically analize and subsequently buy and sell cryptos using the indicators and strategies we are already using.

It's built around the Binance API and uses Flask to setup a webserver. (Used Flask because I was learning it but it was a mistake and I intend to later rebuild it with Django.)

It also utilizes a JS chart to better display the data and I'm currently implementing the indicators using "TA-Lib" and "NumPy". Also looking at "Backtrader" as an alternative/addition to TA-Lib.

At the moment my objective is to see how it fares using this design and then if needed implement also a grid option strategy.

PS: Obviously the Binance key and secret are omitted, feel free to try it using yours when it's finished.
